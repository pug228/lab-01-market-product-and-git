## Personal reflection

I chose backend engineering because it is interesting for me to deeply connect user interfaces in one working web system. I know the basics of such languages like Python, C#, Java etc. I learned frontend basics but need to recall them. Also I started to learn Node.js but did not finish it. In this semester I want to improve git skills and learn more about web servers.
