## Personal reflection

I chose the role of AI engineer because this sphere is very popular now, and really like to analyze data and create the models.

I  have the base knowledge of the required skills, so now I should more practice and go deeper in this sphere.

I wanna to go deeper in working with LLM and in analyze the data and create the models with using python libraries.
